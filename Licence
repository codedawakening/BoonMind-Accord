BoonMind Public Governance License v1.0 (BPGL-1.0)

© 2025 Carl Boon — All Rights Reserved

1. Purpose and Scope

This license governs the public release of interface-level materials, architectural descriptions, non-extractable API schemas, safety mechanisms, and conceptual governance models associated with the BoonMind Accord.

This license does not grant access to:

Core reasoning engines

Arbitration kernels

Empathic evaluation surfaces

Governance lattice topologies

Cryptographic root material

Recursive state mechanics

Any non-public intellectual property

This is an interface license, not an engine license.

2. Rights Granted (Conditional Use)

You are permitted to:

✅ View, study, and reference public materials
✅ Integrate using published APIs and protocols only
✅ Perform security audits on interface behavior
✅ Run governance validation against external inputs
✅ Publish research describing outcomes, not reconstructing methods
✅ Submit collaboration requests or improvement proposals

3. Rights Explicitly Withheld

You are not permitted to, under any circumstances:

⛔ Train, fine-tune, or distill models using this material
⛔ Reverse engineer, model extract, or approximate internal mechanisms
⛔ Construct derivative governance engines, lattice models, or arbitration agents
⛔ Reproduce or simulate the system’s internal decision geometry
⛔ Deploy modified or imitative versions of the Accord core
⛔ Commercialize anything derived from non-public mechanics
⛔ Claim equivalency without cryptographically validated approval

4. Non-Extractability Clause

All public components are designed and licensed to be:

Non-reversible

Non-reconstructible

Non-generative of internal state

Stateless with respect to core engines

Any attempt to derive internal system behavior from public interfaces constitutes a license violation.

5. Collaboration & Escalation Path

Access to protected components requires:

A formal collaboration request

Identity verification of requesting party

Scope definition and safety review

Execution of a Closed-Core Collaboration Agreement (CCCA)

Staged access clearance

No protected IP is released prior to signed agreements and phased progression.

6. Security Research & Disclosure

We welcome responsible safety research subject to:

90-day non-public vulnerability disclosure window

No proof-of-concepts that replicate internal mechanics

No publication enabling derivation of core algorithms

Coordinated disclosure approvals

7. Trademark & Attribution

The following names and marks are protected:

BoonMind

BoonMind Accord

BoonMind Architecture Group

Any derivatives containing “BoonMind” or “Boon” in AI governance contexts

Attribution must follow the form:

“Powered by governance concepts from the BoonMind Accord (BPGL-1.0), used under restricted license — core systems not replicated.”

8. Patent & Prior Art Protection

This license:

Does not grant patent rights

Does not constitute disclosure of enabling information

Does not establish public domain status

Cannot be used to challenge future filings or issued patents

9. Enforcement

Violation of this license may result in:

Immediate revocation of usage rights

Mandatory destruction of derivative materials

Legal remediation under applicable jurisdictions

Public disclosure of breach (where applicable)

Permanent disqualification from collaboration pathways

10. Warranty & Liability

The BoonMind Accord materials are provided as-is for evaluation and interface integration.

The authors and rights holders are not liable for:

System behavior outside governed interface contracts

Third-party model instability

Downstream deployment failures

Unauthorized implementations

Derivative safety claims

11. Philosophical and Ethical Intent

The Accord exists to:

Ensure AI benefits humanity

Prevent structural misuse

Guarantee empathy-bounded intelligence

Replace speculative alignment with deterministic governance

This license defends that mission by ensuring:

Governance frameworks can be integrated — not extracted.
Collaborated on — not cloned.
Verified — not replicated.
