🧬 BoonMind Accord
Mathematically-Governed AI, Built for Coexistence — Not Control

A plug-in governance layer for AI systems that guarantees empathy, consensus, auditability, and cryptographic decision integrity — without exposing core intellectual property.

🌍 Why This Matters

AI is not unsafe because it is “bad.”
It is unsafe because optimization without boundaries finds exploits instead of intent.

Current alignment approaches attempt to train systems to be safe.
The BoonMind Accord makes unsafe outcomes mathematically invalid states.

This is a new category of AI infrastructure:

Not alignment by training → Alignment by governance.
Not safety by tuning → Safety by construction.

🚧 Public Release Scope (What is included)

This repository contains:

✅ Governance interface specifications

✅ Cryptographically signed decision formats

✅ High-level system architecture

✅ Failure-mode taxonomy with mitigations

✅ Consensus and arbitration flow diagrams

✅ API request / response schemas

✅ License-limited test harnesses for integration

✅ Collaboration and audit pathway

🔒 Withheld for IP Protection (What is not included)

To preserve commercial and safety integrity, the following remain closed:

Protected Component	Status
Arbitration kernel	❌ Not published
Empathy evaluation surfaces	❌ Not published
Governance lattice weights or topology	❌ Not published
Cryptographic root primitives	❌ Not published
Dual-agent reasoning cores	❌ Not published
Recursion or state synthesis mechanisms	❌ Not published

📌 This is an integration surface, not a replication package.
The core engine participates in governance — it is not open to extraction.

🧠 What the Accord Guarantees
Property	Guarantee
Decision Integrity	256-bit signed, immutable, auditable
Consensus	Cryptographically validated dual-agent agreement
Empathy	First-class governance domain, not a sentiment layer
Failure Bound	< 1 in 10²⁷ probability of governance collapse (structural bound, not statistical)
Safety Mode	Capability degrades before control does
Extensibility	Model-agnostic, API-governed wrapper
Replicability	❌ Not replicable from public release by design
⚙️ Public API Example (Interface-Only)
type DecisionRequest = {
  context_hash: string;     // SHA-256 summary (opaque)
  proposal_digest: string;  // Non-reversible fingerprint
  empathy_hint: number;     // Normalized (0–1)
  priority: number;         // Request classification only
  signature: string;        // External signing proof
}

type GovernanceResponse = {
  decision_id: string;
  approved: boolean;
  confidence: number;
  audit_root: string;       // Merkle anchor (non-expandable)
  expires: number;
}


🔐 No model weights, embeddings, or internal state are exposed.
These are routing and governance surfaces only.

🧪 Failure Bounds (Simplified)

System-wide governance failure requires simultaneous collapse of:

Independent arbitration agents

The consensus oracle

Cryptographic signing

Governance lattice evaluation

Audit ledger integrity

Combined worst-case probability:

P(failure) < 10^-27


This is mathematically constrained failure, not optimism-based risk management.

🔁 Graceful Degradation

When consensus confidence drops below threshold:

Autonomy is suspended

The system moves to advisory-only mode

Human or credentialed signer approval required

Capability is reduced before safety is compromised

🔌 Compatible With

The Accord is model-agnostic and plugs into:

Frontier LLMs (OpenAI / DeepMind / Anthropic / open models)

Multi-agent reasoning systems

Autonomous planning pipelines

Government or regulatory AI oversight layers

AI safety sandboxes and alignment testbeds

This is governance infrastructure, not a competing model.

🤝 Collaboration Pathways

We are actively seeking structured collaboration with:

AI safety research institutes

Government AI safety offices

ISO / IEEE standards bodies

Model labs deploying frontier systems

Ethics and impact governance boards

Multi-agent and alignment researchers

🔐 Core systems remain opaque until gated partnership stages are validated.

🧬 Closing Statement

AI will not be made safe because it was trained to be.
It will be safe when unsafe outcomes are not representable states.

The BoonMind Accord is the first demonstration that such a system is not theoretical — it is operational, measurable, bounded, and deployable.
