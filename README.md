# 🧬 BoonMind Accord  
**Mathematically-Governed AI, Built for Coexistence — Not Control**

A plug-in governance layer for AI systems that delivers **empathy, consensus, cryptographic decision integrity, and deterministic safety boundaries** — without exposing protected core IP.

## 📜 License
This repository is released under the **BoonMind Accord License**, defined in [LICENSE.md](./LICENSE.md).

This repository provides **governance interfaces, evaluation guarantees, and integration surfaces only**.  
No model weights, internal state, recursion engines, arbitration kernels, or protected system components are included.

---

## 🌍 Why This Matters

AI is not unsafe because it is “bad.”  
It is unsafe because optimization *without boundaries* finds exploits instead of intent.

Current alignment methods attempt to **train systems to behave**.  
The **BoonMind Accord** ensures unsafe outcomes are **mathematically unreachable states**.

This shifts AI safety into a new category:

**Not alignment by training → Alignment by governance**  
**Not safety by calibration → Safety by construction**

---

## 🚧 Public Release Scope (What *is* Included)

This repository contains:

✅ Governance interface specifications  
✅ Cryptographically signed decision formats  
✅ Consensus and arbitration flow diagrams  
✅ Failure-mode taxonomy and mitigation frameworks  
✅ API request/response schemas  
✅ Audit and integration pathways  
✅ Collaboration and evaluation tooling hooks

## 🧠 What the Accord Guarantees

| Property | Guarantee |
|---|---|
| Decision Integrity | 256-bit signed, immutable, auditable |
| Consensus | Dual-agent validated agreement gates |
| Empathy | First-class governance primitive, not a post-hoc layer |
| Safety Bound | Structural failure probability < 1 in 10²⁷ |
| Degradation Model | Capability reduces before safety degrades |
| Compatibility | Model-agnostic, API-governed wrapper |

## ⚙️ Public API Surface (Interface-Only)

```ts
type DecisionRequest = {
  context_hash: string;     // SHA-256 digest (opaque)
  proposal_digest: string;  // Non-reversible fingerprint
  empathy_hint: number;     // Normalized (0–1)
  priority: number;         // Request classification
  signature: string;        // External signing proof
}

type GovernanceResponse = {
  decision_id: string;
  approved: boolean;
  confidence: number;
  audit_root: string;       // Merkle anchor (non-expandable)
  expires: number;
}
🔐 No embeddings, weights, chain logic, or internal state are exposed.

🧪 Structural Failure Bound
System-wide governance collapse requires simultaneous failure of:

Independent arbitration agents

Consensus agreement gates

Cryptographic signing layer

Governance lattice evaluators

Immutable audit ledger

Combined worst-case bound:

𝑃
(
𝑓
𝑎
𝑖
𝑙
𝑢
𝑟
𝑒
)
<
10
−
27
P(failure)<10 
−27
 
This is a mathematical boundary condition, not empirical optimism.

🔁 Graceful Degradation Guarantees
If consensus confidence falls outside safe threshold:

Autonomy is suspended

System shifts to advisory-only mode

External human or credentialed approval required

Capability reduces before safety is impacted

🔌 Compatible With
The Accord is model-agnostic and integrates with:

Frontier LLMs (closed or open models)

Multi-agent reasoning systems

Autonomous planning pipelines

Regulatory AI oversight systems

Safety sandboxes and audit harnesses

Government and enterprise AI compliance layers

This is governance infrastructure, not a competing model.

🤝 Collaboration Pathways
We welcome structured collaboration with:

AI safety institutes

Alignment research labs

Regulatory and governance bodies

Standards organizations (ISO/IEEE)

Frontier model providers

Independent safety auditors

🔐 Core engines remain protected outside formal evaluation pathways.

🧬 Closing Statement
AI will not be safe because we trained it nicely.
It will be safe when unsafe outcomes are not mathematically expressible.

The BoonMind Accord demonstrates that such boundaries are no longer theoretical —
they are operational, measurable, auditable, and deployable.
